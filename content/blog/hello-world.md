# hello world

this is the obligatory first post. you know the deal.

## why this site exists

i needed a place to share thoughts on building software, open source, and whatever else comes to mind. no medium paywalls, no substack emails, just plain text and markdown.

## what to expect

- deep dives into projects i'm working on
- lessons learned from building kaneo
- thoughts on developer tools and workflows
- occasional hot takes on tech

## the stack

this site is intentionally minimal:
- go templates for rendering
- markdown for content
- no javascript (except for the cmd+k search)
- no build complexity

fast, simple, maintainable. that's the goal.

more posts coming soon.
